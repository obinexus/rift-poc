# RIFT-0 Documentation

This directory contains all documentation for the RIFT-0 stage, including module specifications, governance, and implementation notes.

## Structure
- All `.md` and `.pdf` documentation for RIFT-0 must be placed here.
- Each module (core, lexer, cli, governance, etc.) should have its own documentation file.

## Module Documentation Guidelines
- Use clear module names: `core.md`, `lexer.md`, `cli.md`, `governance.md`, etc.
- For PDF docs, use the same naming convention: `core.pdf`, `lexer.pdf`, etc.
- All documentation should follow the RIFT and AEGIS/PoliC compliance standards.

## Example
- `core.md` — Core architecture and API
- `lexer.md` — Lexical analysis and regex engine
- `cli.md` — CLI command structure and usage
- `governance.md` — Governance and compliance for Stage-0

## Notes
- This folder replaces the old root-level `docs/`.
- All future documentation for RIFT-0 must be placed here for consistency and compliance.

## QA Compliance

This documentation structure follows AEGIS Waterfall methodology requirements:
- Systematic organization of technical materials
- Comprehensive coverage of all project phases
- Audit trail maintenance through version control
- Collaborative development support through clear structure

## Navigation

For stage-specific documentation, refer to:
- Stage implementations: `rift/src/core/stage-N/`
- Stage APIs: `rift/include/rift/core/stage-N/`
- Stage testing: `qa/tests/`
